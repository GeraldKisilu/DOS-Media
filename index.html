        <center>Hello! Welcome to DOS Media, a very reputable company known for its value in customer satisfaction. Our company
            is well known for creating memorable experiences as well as capturing the moments to make them last forever. At DOS Media,
            we express our viability in taking snapshots ranging from various events(Weddings, Graduations, Parties and any other island 
            of relevancies), taping podcasts as well as live events, natural and environmental reviews through media intervention, et cetera. 
            We are proud to inform you that based on our customer feedback, we have decided to indulge into a mechanical media convention
            to improve the quality of our drudgery on the client side. We would so much like to avoid social media platforms in the delivery 
            of our content as it diminishes the quality. Therefore! We are welcoming all our esteemed customers on this new journey for 
            clarification, satisfaction and gladness. ENJOY!
        </center>
